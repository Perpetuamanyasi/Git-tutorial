## BMI Calcualator

In this project, we are going to write a python program to  calculate the BMI.


Measurements:

1. Weight(kgs)

2. height(m)

BMI =Weight/(height*height)
 
We will use the BMI to determine whether the user is Overweight, Normal or Underweight

## Results

If BMI > 25 the person is overweight

If BM1 < 18 the person is Underweight

if BMI is 18  to 25 the person is normal
